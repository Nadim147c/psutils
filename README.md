# Utility Commands

A set of utility commands that made by me for myself. All of these commands was in my powershell startup script. But I was having difficulties maintaining all of these commands from a single file. That's why I created this repository.

> If you wanna use these commands, create a fork. I always change how these commands work and their name. That's why I suggest creating your own fork so that my stupid changes doesn't effect you.
